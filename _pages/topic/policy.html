<p>SDG reporting is country-led and country-driven. Each country is expected to apply its own policies, institutional frameworks, and implementation strategies to prioritize nationally relevant SDGs, and while the 2030 Agenda sets targets for outcomes it does not prescribe specific processes to meet them. </p><p>A number of policy considerations may inform the choice of an SDG reporting approach. These may include the relationship of the SDGs to national priorities, the leadership and coordination required for SDG reporting, other reporting requirements, and the need to ensure data privacy and security. Additionally, combining SDG reporting needs with other reporting requirements can minimize government reporting burdens, reduce duplication of efforts and ensure consistency of data. </p>
