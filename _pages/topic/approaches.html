<p>There are many options for reporting on the SDGs to meet the needs of countries. Countries typically adopt one of three models to reporting on the SDGs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Incorporating SDG reporting within an existing national website or platform.</li>
  <li>Developing an entirely new platform dedicated to providing data on the SDGs.</li>
  <li>Providing their data to a regionally-maintained platform.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Several are repurposing and adapting platforms that were utilized to report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>
