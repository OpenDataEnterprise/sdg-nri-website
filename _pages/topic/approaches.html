<p>There are many options for reporting on the SDGs to meet the needs of countries. Countries typically adopt one of three models to reporting on the SDGs. Some are incorporating SDG reporting within an existing national website or platform. Others have developed entirely new platforms dedicated to providing data on the SDGs. And still other countries are providing their data to a regionally-maintained platform. Several are repurposing and adapting platforms that were utilized to report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). </p>
