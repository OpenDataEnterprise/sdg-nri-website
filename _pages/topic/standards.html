<p class="topic-description-intro">Open data - making data free, publicly available, and machine-readable for anyone to access and use, without restrictions -  is a key operating principle for producing data for use and impact.</p>

<p>The use of data and metadata standards can ensure national and international interoperability. Standardization can help improve data quality and make different datasets comparable. Without common definitions, it is much harder to compare data and understand progress both within countries and between countries.</p>

<p>Metadata can be defined as “data that define and describe other data”, though some can also describe “other resources that are relevant to the collection, processing and dissemination of data (for example, questionnaires and publications) rather than relating directly to data themselves.”</p>
