<p>As countries set their objectives for SDG reporting, they may evaluate the extent to which the SDGs relate to their national strategies for development and other policy priorities, including both sectoral and subnational strategies and policies. They will also need to consider set-up and maintenance costs, and technical capacity requirements for SDG reporting.</p>
<p>This section includes resources on policy considerations, stakeholder engagement, financing and capacity relevant to SDG reporting.</p>
