<p class="topic-description-intro">Depending on the priorities of an SDG reporting approach, a platform may require features ranging from data dissemination to data collection and management.</p>

<h2>Data Access and Visualization</h2>

<p>SDG reporting platforms provide a range of features allowing users to explore and download data and metadata. Examples of these include graphs depicting changes by year, or broken down by key variables such as gender, subnational region, or age. Often, platforms will allow users not only to view the data online but also to download the raw data. Additional graphics may include maps to allow users to easily understand geographical variances in development, or dashboards indicating progress towards national targets.</p>

<h2>Data Input and Management</h2>

<p>Countries may look to SDG reporting models to go beyond data dissemination, allowing them to strengthen their information systems more generally, from data collection to publication. In such cases, additional data input and management features are beneficial. For example, these can include data validation mechanisms to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data, automated data entry to increase efficiency, and internal dashboards to gain a better picture of data availability and gaps.</p>
