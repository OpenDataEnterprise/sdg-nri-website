<p>A critical aspect of each open-source SDG reporting platform is the mechanism used to enter and maintain the statistics and metadata. This will be important to consider early in the project, in order to enable data providers to populate the platform effectively. Important considerations include the expected data format, the workflow for data updates, and the available options for secure user-management.</p>
