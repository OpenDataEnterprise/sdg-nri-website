<p>Open-source SDG reporting platforms can serve to gather, host, secure, and display the SDG indicator data and metadata. Some countries have utilized open-source tools for specific functions such as data quality checks or analysis. Open-source platforms allow countries to share progress and developments with others using this approach.</p>
