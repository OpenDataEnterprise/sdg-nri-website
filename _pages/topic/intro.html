<p>The UN <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs" target="_blank">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs), adopted in 2015, are a historic commitment to take on the world’s most pressing and intractable problems. These 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) make up what has become known as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and are supported by 169 targets and 232 indicators. </p><p>From the beginning, the SDGs have been closely tied to the <a href="http://www.undatarevolution.org/data-revolution/" target="_blank">UN Data Revolution</a>. The concept of the Data Revolution recognizes that we now face “an exponential increase in the volume and types of data available, creating unprecedented possibilities for informing and transforming society and protecting the environment.”</p>
